Project Bubble in your WordPress admin and on your website.

== Description ==

[Project Bubble](http://projectbubble.com/) is a simple tool for managing your projects and collaborating with your team.

**This plugin is third-party stuff and it isn't directly associated with Project Bubble LLC or officially supported by their developers.**

The purpose of the plugin is to connect this cool project management tool with your WordPress website.

This is just the first basic release. The future version will try to bring full management for your Project Bubble account directly from the WordPress dashboard. Be prepared for much more!

TODO:

*   Complete stats and overview what is going on.
*   View/Add/Edit/Delete projects, tasks, clients, time sheets, invoices...
*   Admin notification and reports.
*   Shortcodes to display all the data anywhere you want.
*   More forms for you and your visitors to add data or comment on existing one.

**Are you missing something or isn't it working as expected ? I am open to suggestions to improve the plugin !**
